Quiz: Deep Learning 6 questions

1 Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)

    Linear classifiers are never useful, because they cannot represent XOR.
    Linear classifiers are useful, because, with enough data, they can represent anything.
    Having good non-linear features can allow us to learn very accurate linear classifiers.

answer:- 4


4 Which of the following statements is true? (Check all that apply)

   1). Features in computer vision act like local detectors.
   2).Deep learning has had impact in computer vision, because itâ€™s used to combine all the different hand-created features            that already exist.
   3). By learning non-linear features, neural networks have allowed us to automatically learn detectors for computer              vision.
   4).none of the above
    
answer:- 1,3

5 If you have lots of images of different types of plankton labeled with their species name, and lots of computational resources, what would you expect to perform better predictions:

   1). a deep neural network trained on this data.
   2). a simple classifier trained on this data, using deep features as input, which were trained using ImageNet data.

answer:- 1
